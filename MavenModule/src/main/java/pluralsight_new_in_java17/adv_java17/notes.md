## Records

Records are immutable data classes that require only the type and name of fields.
The equals, hashCode, and toString methods, as well as the private, final fields and public constructor, are generated by the Java compiler.

Useful for for ex domain objects. Not for JPA entities and singletons.

## Sealed classes

A superclass that is developed with a set of its subclasses should be able to document its intended usage, not constrain its subclasses. Also, having restricted subclasses should not limit the accessibility of its superclass.
Thus, the main motivation behind sealed classes is to have the possibility for a superclass to be widely accessible but not widely extensible.
The sealed feature introduces a couple of new modifiers and clauses in Java: sealed, non-sealed, and permits.

To seal an interface, we can apply the sealed modifier to its declaration. The permits clause then specifies the classes that are permitted to implement the sealed interface
