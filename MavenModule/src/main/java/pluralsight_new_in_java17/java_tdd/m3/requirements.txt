Requirement:
    Truncate title, 1st paragraph or another string with "..."
    if over character limit (width must be flexible)

Think stage:
--------------------

Inputs?
    - String
    - Character limit

-> Let's start with a method with two arguments

Start with tests:
    - Char limit reached -> truncate with "..."
    - Char limit not reached -> no change

Next set of tests:
    - Invalid String (null)
    - Invalid limit (0 or less)

More complex tests (combinatorics):

    What if?
        - input < ellipsis
        - input == ellipsis

    -> Check with BA -> input should not be truncated
