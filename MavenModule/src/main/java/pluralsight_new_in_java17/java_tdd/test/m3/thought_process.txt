Found first bug - StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

Found second bug - string changes when limit == input length, but it shouldn't

Let's add one more test to check minimum allowed limit works

Realize a sin:
    - one test knows about the internals of the implementation (ellipsis length)
    - solution - implement and test 3-arg truncate

TODO - more tests:
    - How to treat blank strings?
    - Should we vary input length to have varied more test data?
