    -> refactor to use Money API

Should we create portfolios with existing stocks?
No, create an empty portfolio first, then add() stocks

We started testing with very large step - portfolio total value
    - What about testing individual pieces of data of individual stocks first?


It's OK to start over sometimes, TDD shouldn't let you go very far

At this point, we coded up a desired API in our tests - getPosition("symbol")
    This makes us move from List to Map

Merging stocks into one position makes us rethink the getPx method name too
