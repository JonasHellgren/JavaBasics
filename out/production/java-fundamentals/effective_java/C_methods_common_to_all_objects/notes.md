# Methods Common to All Objects

* Item 10: Obey the general contract when overriding equals

  <em>
The first advice says not to override the equals method for classes where each instance of the class is equal only to itself. 
On the contrary, itâ€™s appropriate to override equals only on values classes.

        //check if the argument is a reference to this object
        //check if the argument has the correct typ
        //For each significant field in the class, check if that field matches the corresponding field of this object

</em>

* Item 11: Always override hashCode when you override equals
  
* Item 12: Always override toString
  
* Item 13: Override clone judiciously
