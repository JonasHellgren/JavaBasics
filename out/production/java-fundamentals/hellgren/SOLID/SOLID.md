# SOLID

## Single Responsibility
Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software

## Open/Closed
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

# Liskov Substitution
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

Inherited methods in sub-class shall all be needed.

# Interface Segregation principles
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

# Dependency Inversion
Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.

This principle allows for decoupling.
