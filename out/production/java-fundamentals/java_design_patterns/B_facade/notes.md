# Facade Design Pattern

Simply put, a facade encapsulates a complex subsystem behind a simple interface. It hides much of the complexity and 
makes the subsystem easy to use. Also, if we need to use the complex subsystem directly, we still can do that; 
we aren't forced to use the facade all the time.
