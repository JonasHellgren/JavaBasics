# Domain driven design


Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach focused on modeling software to match a domain according to input from that domain's experts. Here’s a general description of key DDD concepts and their relationships:

## Entity
An entity is an object that is defined primarily by its identity rather than its attributes. Entities have a distinct lifecycle and an identity that runs through that lifecycle. For example, a "User" in a system is an entity because it is identified by its user ID.

## Value Object
A value object is an object that describes some characteristics or attributes but has no concept of identity. Value objects are immutable and can be compared based on their attributes. For example, an "Address" can be a value object because it is described by its street, city, and zip code attributes.

## Aggregate
An aggregate is a cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. Each aggregate has a root entity known as the aggregate root, which is the only entity that external objects are allowed to reference. The aggregate root ensures the consistency of changes within the aggregate. For example, an "Order" can be an aggregate with "Order Line" entities as part of it, where the "Order" itself is the aggregate root.

## Service
A service is an operation or a set of operations that perform business logic that doesn’t naturally fit into an entity or a value object. Services are typically stateless. There are three types of services:

### Domain Service
Encapsulates domain logic that doesn’t naturally belong to an entity or value object.
### Application Service
Orchestrates the application's operations, serving as a boundary between the domain and the application layer.
### Infrastructure Service
Handles technical concerns such as sending emails or integrating with other systems.

## Relationships
### Entities and Value Objects
Entities can reference value objects. For instance, a "User" entity might have a "Profile" value object containing the user’s profile information.
### Aggregates and Entities
An aggregate root manages the lifecycle and relationships of its entities. External operations only interact with the aggregate root, not directly with child entities.
### Services and Aggregates
Services often interact with aggregates to perform complex operations that involve multiple entities. For example, an application service might coordinate the process of placing an order, involving operations on "Order" and "Inventory" aggregates.
